      <p>
        I am a Computer Science student at SRM University and multilingual
        speaker with a passion for ethical hacking, artificial intelligence, and
        neural language processing. I am looking to join a company that values
        innovation, collaboration, and continuous learning and am confident that
        my enthusiasm and drive will help me succeed in any role that leverages
        my passion for technology.
